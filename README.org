* Git Literate Labs

This is my attempt with idempotent literate Git labs made with Org-Babel in Emacs. 

If you want to re-use it, make sure you have changed the =#+properties= setting (specifically the =:dir= value) to your local preferences.

Everything else should be working with the default settings. I use Emacs v27.1 with Org-Mode v9.3.7 - though it should be working on earlier versions as well.
